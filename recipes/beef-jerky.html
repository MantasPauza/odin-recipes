          Beef Jerky… <br />
          <br />
          <b> Yummy, right? </b> Except I dare you to find some at the store
          that isn't absolutely LOADED with a crazy amount of all sorts of
          chemicals and nasties. Sugar, Corn Syrup, Caramel Color, Soy Sauce,
          Monosodium Glutamate, Fermented Soy Beans, Maltodextrin, Hydrolized
          Corn Gluten <b> (REALLY?) </b>, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Erythorbate,
          these are some of the ingredients that are commonly listed on packages
          of beef jerky <br />
          <br />
          I don't know about you, but I think I'll pass…
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Let's take a look at how it's done, so you can learn to do it at home,
          shall we?

        <h5>INSTRUCTIONS</h5>
        <ol class="d-flex flex-column gap-3">
          <li>
            Remove all traces of visible fat from your piece (or pieces) of
            meat. Place the meat in the freezer for about 60 to 90 minutes,
            which will make it easier to slice thinly. Don't wait until the meat
            is frozen solid, you just want ice crystals to start to form. It
            should be really firm but you should still be able to pierce it with
            the point of a sharp knife.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slice the meat in long thin strips, going with or against the grain
            depending on your preference. Jerky sliced against the grain tends
            to be easier to chew and breaks more easily into pieces whereas
            jerky that is sliced with the grain will be a lot chewier and
            somewhat leathery.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place your meat in a re-sealable plastic bag, or non-reactive
            container with fitting lid, and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large measuring cup or mixing bowl, add all the ingredients for
            the marinade and mix until very well combined. Pour over the sliced
            meat and mix everything around until all the strips are completely
            covered.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place your meat in the refrigerator and let it marinate overnight.
          </li>
          <li>
            VERY IMPORTANT! Before you go any further, cover the bottom of your
            oven with aluminium foil. Things are going to get messy!
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the strips of meat from the marinade and place them directly
            on your oven racks. No need to pat them dry, just let the strips
            drip a little bit as you remove them. If you have smaller pieces
            that will not fit on the racks without falling right through the
            cracks, arrange them on a cooling rack and place that rack right
            over the oven rack. You can even stack it right on top of an oven
            rack that already has meat on it: simply rest it on a few shot
            glasses or egg cups or other suitable small object. Don't worry
            about it burning or breaking, we're not going to turn the heat all
            that high.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place your racks back in the oven, the higher the better, and set
            your oven temperature to 170F. If you have a convection oven, by all
            means, use that setting. Keep the oven door slightly open by
            sticking a wooden spoon or crushed aluminum can in the door. This
            will allow some of the heat to escape so the meat has a chance to
            dry without cooking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the meat dry for about 3 hours, then flip it over and give it
            another 3 hours or so. Total cooking time depends a lot on the size
            and thickness of your strips.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your jerky will be done when it's dry enough that you can rip off a
            piece easily but not so dry that it'l snap if you bend it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Leave the jerky out to cool for a couple of hours, up to 24, then
            transfer to an airtight container or sealed plastic bag where it
            will keep unrefrigerated for 4 to 6 months - but I dare you to keep
            it that long!
          </li>
