      <p>
        To all Lithuanians, the cold beet soup cult is well-known from the
        childhood but to most foreigners this soup looks very interesting.
        Usually, it's incomprehensible why this soup is eaten cold, why is the
        color so pink or why the soup is made from kefir..? <br />
        Well, and other similar questions are always askedâ€¦ But of course, cold
        beet soup can be liked or disliked only after you try it. So this is
        your chance now! ðŸ™‚
      </p>
      <h5>Here's a list of ingredients!</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Kefir or butter milk: 1 l (1 quart)</li>
        <li>Milk: 150 ml (3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>Pickled beets: 2 medium-sized</li>
        <li>Cucumbers: 2 medium-sized</li>
        <li>Chopped onion greens: 1 large handful</li>
        <li>Chopped dill: 1 handful</li>
        <li>Hard boiled eggs: 2</li>
        <li>Boiled potatoes with a peel: 8 small</li>
        <li>Salt: to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>INSTRUCTIONS</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Firstly, pour kefir into a big bowl.</li>
        <li>
          Cut the beetroots into really tiny stripes. Put in a bowl together
          with kefir.
        </li>
        <li>
          Than peel the cucumbers and cut it into thin, narrow strips. Put
          together in a bowl with kefir. If the cucumbers have large seeds then
          remove them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put dill and onion greens into a bowl with kefir. Mix the soup, add
          salt to your own taste. If the kefir is quite thick, then add some
          milk. If you want thick beet soup then don't use milk at all.
        </li>
        <li>
          Peel the boiled eggs, cut into several pieces and put them on each
          bowl with cold beet soup before serving. Serve with boiled or baked
          potatoes.
        </li>
        <li><b>Note:</b> You can replace milk with cold boiled water.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Note:</b> You can also add sour cream on the top of beet soup
          before serving.
